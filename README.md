# Elden Ring Anti Cheat Toggle

Hello there, welcome to my first uhh, general purpose tool I guess? Idk. Anyways uh this is the Elden Ring Anti Cheat Toggle. As the name implies This allows you to toggle the anti cheat of Elden Ring without having to rename your files yourself!


## How to use

So upon first launch you will be prompted to put in the game path, eg. : `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game`. Yours may be different depending on where you installed the game so change it as needed of course! Anyways after you do that, you'll have to restart the program.

Once you do that, you won't ever have to reprompted for the path. All you gotta do is just enter 1 or 2 into the program (1 being on, 2 being off) and boom, depending on the choice, the Anti Cheat will be go byebye or not byebye.

## Final words
Admittedly this is a very simple program but I was happy with it so I decided fuck it, and share it.
Enjoy it
